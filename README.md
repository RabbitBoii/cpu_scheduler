# CPU Scheduler Project ACM

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms in C++. The algorithms included are:
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Preemptive
- Round Robin (RR)

Users can input the details of each process and see the scheduling results, including waiting times and turnaround times.

## Features

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Executes processes in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive**: Selects the process with the shortest burst time.
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Preemptive**: Preemptive version of SJF, selects the process with the shortest remaining time.
- **Round Robin (RR)**: Each process is assigned a fixed time in a cyclic order.
